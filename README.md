DeliveryTrackingService
The Test was written in Asp.Net Core 3.1 and repository is hosted on Github.<br />

Steps to Run the Code<br />
pre-requisite<br />
Asp.Net Core 3.1<br />
C# (at least 7.0)<br />
an IDE or Editor(Visual Studio Code) or any terminal (provided dotnet cli has been added to path)<br />
1). Clone the repository to your desired directory<br />
2). a) Through terminal, <br />
        i) navigate to the directory where you clone the repo to,<br />
        ii) run dotnet restore, to restore the project and its dependencies<br />
        iii) run dotnet build to build first<br />
        iv) run dotnet run to run it with defualt 5000 as port. Note, if you have any other application making use of port 5000, <br />
            then you will need to run the code like dis dotnet run --port <any_port_of_your_choice><br />
         v) step iv will launch your default browser, and by default swagger will be open, if it did not open then you go to /index of the app url in the browser <br />
         vi) after step v, you will see several endpoints that you test to run the code<br /><br />
     b) Through IDE (Visual Studio or Rider or Mono Develop or Visual Studio for Mac)<br />
     i) Go to the folder where you clone the repo<br />
     ii) open folder of the repo and double click on the solution file.<br />
     iii) from step iii, it will automatically open the project in the default app (i.e. visual studio if you have it installed or rider..etc)<br />
     iv) as soon as the IDE open, give it a few minute to automatically, load and restore the project<br />
     v). You can now click on launch or start debugging (open Debug menu and click on start debugging).<br />
     vi) It should launch a browser, then available endpoint will come out.<br />
     <br />
     <br />
  3) To run the Test. <br />
  you can either navigate to the project directory on command line and run dotnet test to run the test or open it on IDE and run the test appropriately <br />
